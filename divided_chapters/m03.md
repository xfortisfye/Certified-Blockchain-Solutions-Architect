# M3 Ethereum Blockchain

## L05: Ethereum Blockchain Platform 

### 5.1 Ethereum Basics

History - The total supply of ether and its rate of issuance was decided by the donations gathered on the 2014 presale of the currency 
- 60 million ether created for the contributors of the presale 
- 12 million (20% of the above) were created for the development fund (early contributors and developers) and the remaining for the Ethereum Foundation 
- 5 ethers are created every block (about 15 seconds) for the miner of the block 
- 2-3 ethers may be sent to the uncle (rewards) 
- Most widely used Open Source Blockchain-based distributed computing application platform 
- Mainly used for building and implementing smart contracts functionality 
- It offers a Decentralised Virtual Machine aka Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) 
- Initiated by Vitalik Buterin in 2013 
- Ethereum's live Blockchain was launched on 30 July 2015 

Definitions 
- Ether is the native token of the Ethereum blockchain which is used to pay for transaction fees, miner rewards and other services on the network 
- Ethereum is an open software platform based on blockchain technology that enables developers to write smart contracts and build and deploy decentralised applications 

Ethereum has four main components 
- Nodes 
- Ethereum Virtual Machines 
- Smart Contracts 
- dApps 

Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) 
- Built into software running on the Ethereum protocol. It executes smart contracts (Ethereum programs written in the Solidity language) 
- The EVM is contained in the full nodes of the Ethereum network, inside of which it executes these Ethereum-user-written programs (smart contracts) 

EVM Code 
- EVM code is the programming language in which accounts on the Ethereum blockchain can contain code 
- The EVM code associated with an account is executed every time a message is sent to that account, and has the ability to read/write storage and itself send messages 

Gas 
- Measurement roughly equivalent to computational steps for Ethereum 
- Every transaction is required to include a gas limit and a fee that it is willing to pay per gas; miners have the choice of including the transaction and collecting the fee or not 
- Every operation has a gas expenditure on an EVM 

Ethereum 
- The Ethereum blockchain is a transaction-based state machine 
- In computer science, a state machine refers to something that will read a series of inputs and based on those inputs, will transition to a new state 
- Genesis State is the beginning state and then to the final state 
- For a transaction to be considered valid, it has to be processed by a validation process known as blockchain mining 
- Mining is when a group of nodes use their computing resources to create a block of valid transactions 

### 5.2 Ethereum Architecture

Ethereum Architecture 
- When designing or architecting your blockchain, there are some key areas to focus on 
- Private or Public dApps 
- Global Scaling 
- APIs 
- Smart Contract 
- User Interface 

The Ethereum protocol design process follows a number of principles. These principles are all involved in guiding Ethereum development, but they are not absolute 
- Sandwich Complexity Model 
  - Essentially like a three tier development best practice scenario to limit your complexity 
    - Top: User interface
    - Middle: Programming and Development
    - Bottom: Smart contract 
  - Avoid complexity by having the top and the bottom to be as simple, whereas the middle is to introduce your complexity. 
- Freedom 
  - Not limiting what you can do in Ethereum from a development standpoint 
  - If want to add additional capabilities or restrict, it's possible and up to us 
- Generalisation 
  - An approach where the development best practices is to make things as low layer as possible without restricting anything or making things too simplistic 
- We Have No Features 
  - Motto of Ethereum to make the platform as robust as possible 
    - Without worry about design features into it 
    - Modular 
- Non-risk-aversion 
  - Want to take risk instead of averting risk if it is totally not necessary 
- https://ethereumbuilders.gitbooks.io/guide/content/en/design_rationale.html 

Ethereum attends to the principals well by building what is essentially the ultimate abstract foundational layer 
- A blockchain with a built-in Turing complete programming language 
- Solidity is similar to Javascript 

Ethereum Architecture is built for both decentralisation and for distribution of content, processing etc. 

## L06: Ethereum Consensus

### 6.1 Blockchain Transactions

![img](img/6.1_01.png)

- Joe and Sally must have a wallet 
- Joe purchase Bitcoin and place in wallet 
- Joe initiate transfer of Bitcoin to Sally 
- Joe uses private key and signature and send its encrypted information over to the blockchain network which is a Bitcoin network. 
- Joe's private key will be synced up into blockchain to validate it's him, and that he possess the fund. Thus validating Joe that he possesses the right amount of Bitcoin to send to Sally 
- Assuming she has the right key, Sally will be able to receive the money into her wallet. 

Encryption --> Validation --> Distribution --> Written to Ledger (Immutable). 

### 6.2 Ethereum Architecture Overview

| Ethereum  Architecture |
| --- |
| Dapps |
| Smart Contracts |
| EVM |
| Nodes --> Ledger |
| Network |

- It has to be on a network (Internet). 
- Nodes are going to be deployed, where the ledger will be maintained 
- EVM will help to deploy the Smart Contract and Dapps 
- Smart Contracts are executable codes/computer program. 
- DApps is a collection of smart contracts 

### 6.3 Ethereum Ledger

Ethereum Ledger 
- Consensus is when the distributed ledger has been updated and all nodes maintain their own identical copy of the ledger 
- This architecture allows for a new capacity as a system of recordkeeping that goes beyond being a simple database 
- In Ethereum, the ledger is used for blockchain transactions 
- To access ledger, you need the keys 
- Ethereum uses public key cryptography for authentication 
  - Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) secp256k1's curve is used 
- The private key is random 256 bit data sequence. 

## L07: Ethereum Value 

### 7.1 Ethereum Tokens 

When providing value, tokens is a good way to enable the platform to be able to provide value to users 

Ethereum Tokens 
- Ether is the native token of the Ethereum blockchain which is used to pay for transaction fees, miner rewards and other services on the network.  
- Using the Ethereum network requires you to pay for the privilege with gas 

Two Types of Tokens 
- Usage Tokens 
  - These are tokens in specific blockchain that are similar to their own native currency in their Dapps 
  - E.g., Golem or a gaming platform 

Work Tokens 
- These are the tokens that identify you as a sort of shareholder in the Dapps
- As a shareholder, you generally have some voting rights 
- E.g., Dash where you would possess tokens and have voting rights 

ERC20 defines a common list of protocols that an Ethereum token has to implement. 
- Allows developers to program behaviour of new tokens within the Ethereum ecosystem 
  - Common with crowdfunding companies via Initial Coin Offerings 

Coin Swap
- Change the current token to a new version token after an ICO 
- More on Ether Tokens: https://etherscan.io/tokens 

### 7.2 Ethereum Smart Contracts

The main value that Ethereum provides to organisations is the fact that you could write and implement smart contracts 

Smart Contracts 
- Describe computer program code that is capable of facilitating, executing and enforcing the negotiation or performance of an agreement using blockchain technology (Contract) 
- Entire process is automated and can act as a complement, or substitute for legal contracts 
- Terms of smart contract are recorded in a computer language as a set of instructions 
- Define the rules and penalties around an agreement in the same way that a traditional contract does 
- Automatically enforce those obligations 
- Several smart contracts can make up a DApps 

Smart Contracts provide: 
- Autonomy 
- Trust 
- Backup 
- Safety 
- Speed 
- Savings 
- Accuracy 

Type of Functions which are required in a smart contract 
- Constructor Function 
  - Function which is called only once when deploying smart contract 
    - E.g., used to receive the initial Ether sent to it at time of deployment 
- Fallback Function 
  - Function is essentially without a name and generally defined as a function in a code. 
    - E.g., (defined as function (){code…})  
  - Invoked when someone sends Ether to the address of your smart contract.  
  - If this function is not programmed, Ether sent to the smart contract will be rejected 

Smart Contracts 
- Provide security that is better than traditional contracts 
- Cut transactional costs associated with traditional contracting 
- Smart contracts on Ethereum network run on Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) [A Turing-based machine] 
- The Decentralised Applications (DApps) running on the Ethereum network are basically complex Smart Contracts 

Smart Contracts Enforcement 
- Basics of Ethereum states that all modifications to a contract's data must be performed by its code 
- Modification of a contract's data requires a blockchain user to send requests to its code. This process kickoff determines whether and how to fulfill those requests. 
- A traditional database uses an enforced stored procedure 
  - Think of this approach as predefined rules in blockchain

Smart Contracts Legal Enforcement 
- Smart Contracts may not be legally enforceable, especially across borders or jurisdictions 
- Could be used as evidence 
- Think of a vending machine where you put in the required funds to get the drinks or food 

### 7.3 Smart Contract Workflow

![img](img/7.3_01.png)

A smart contract is code that has been written to execute when conditions are met. 
- A contract has to have specific terms and currency conditions set. 
  - Has the money been sent? Is it the right amount? What about the timing? Or any other conditions. 
- As long as conditions are met, this mean that events will be triggered / events has been met. 
- Contracts will execute when all the terms are met. 
- Once the contract has executed, then the contract has been settled. 

The smart contract workflow can be done in several different ways to settle contracts 
- On-chain 
  - It is on the blockchain 
- Off-chain 
  - It could be sent to a payment gateway or another cryptocurrency gateway or blockchain.

## L08: Ethereum Platform

### 8.1 Ethereum DApps

Dapps (Decentralised Applications) 
- Applications that run on a P2P Network of computers, instead of a single computer 
- One or more smart contracts 
- Generally is open source 
- Data and records of operation of application to be cryptographically stored on ledger 
- Use cryptographic token 
- Generate tokens 
- Decentralised P2P Network 
- Access with Mist Browser 

### 8.2 Ethereum Gas Estimates

Estimate how much it cost to run the DApps with Gas 

Gas Price 
- Amount of Ether that you are willing to spend on every unit of gas 
- Need to determine the price of gas you want to pay for and the maximum amount of gas you want to spend on performing a transaction on the Ethereum network 
- The more important the processing of the transaction, the higher the price should be paid 

![img](img/8.2_01.png)

Use Metamask for confirming your transaction 
- Balance
- Gas limit 
- Gas Price 
- Can proceed to buy more Ether at Coinbase or Shapeshift 

Gas Price Units 
- Gwei = Unit of Ethereum coin used to calculate transaction Fee 
- One Ethereum coin is worth 1 billion Gwei 
- https://www.myetherwallet.com 

[ETH Gas Station](https://ethgasstation.info)
- Aims to increase the transparency of gas prices, transaction confirmation times, and miner policies on the Ethereum network 

### 8.3 Ethereum Virtual Machine

Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) 
- Computer software which runs at an abstraction layer straight above the underlying hardware (hypervisor) 
- Uses a Turing Complete Virtual Machine for running and compiling the codes 
  - Turing Complete states that this software is agile enough to run any code defined by the developer or user 
- EVM has limitation that a typical Turing Complete machine does not, which is that the EVM is intrinsically bound by gas 
- Power of EVM is limited by the amount of gas 
- Stack based VM (last-in-first-out stack) to hold temporary values 
- Implementation can be in Python, ruby, C++ and other languages 
- Fully isolated from network 

> In other words, the developers of Ethereum thought of a really creative way to limit some of the challenges that a token or cryptocurrency could induce. Essentially you can limit that VM by what you want to pay. Now, if you think about it, the price of Ethereum goes up and down every day. So let's say you decide to spend $10 at 6 p.m. and the price of Ethereum goes up 10%. Well, instead of that $10 you're spending, you would spend 11 by the time you execute. 
 
> So let's go ahead and sum this up. Let's make sure we get the terminology. With the EVM, it's going to use what's called gas. Now, gas is essentially going to be provisioned to the miners and that's essentially a way for you to pay an ether to be able to use the Ethereum network. Now, the developers of Ethereum were really creative with gas and basically they understood that the cryptocurrency, the token price could fluctuate, and it's a way for you as a developer to be able to propose a cost and stay within that cost. 

> According to them you can set fix limit. but the price of the gas is not fixed. So if gas is more than your limit, you wont be able to use the network. 

> Gas will change accordingly to the value based on the price of Ethereum so that the amount will always stay the same value of Ethereum at the end regardless of how much Ethereum changes 

### 8.4 Ethereum Networks

The Ethereum network has some terms to know around nodes and type of nodes 
- A node is a device (eventually runs EVM) , program, virtual machine that communicates with the Ethereum network 
- Node are also knowns as clients 
 
Ethereum Node Types 
- When joining the Ethereum network, you have some options of running various types of nodes 
  - Full node verify block that is broadcast onto the network 
    - Think of full node as a node that has the full blockchain 
  - Light node do not verify every block or transaction and do not have a copy of the current blockchain state 
    - A light node has a somewhat up-to-date but not the full blockchain downloaded 
  - Archive node are full nodes that preserve the entire history of transactions 
 
Ethereum Network 
- MainNet is data on the blockchain (which is the production Ethereum network) that includes account balances and transactions, which are public, and anyone can create a node and begin verifying transactions 
- Ether on this network has a market value and can be exchanged for other cryptocurrency or fiat currencies 
 
Three Main types of extended Ethereum Networks 
- Public Test Networks 
- Enterprise/Private Networks 
- Local Test Networks 
 
Public Test Networks (known as Testnets) 
- Public Test Network is used by developers to test Ethereum applications before final deployment to the main network (MainNet) 
- Ether on these networks is used for testing purposes only and has no value 
- E.g., Ropsten, Koven, Rinkeby 
  - [Ropsten](https://ropsten.etherscan.io): A proof-of-work blockchain that most closely resembles Ethereum; you can easily mine faux-Ether.  
  - Kovan: A proof-of-authority blockchain, started by the Parity team.  
  - Rinkeby: A proof-of-authority blockchain, started by the Geth team 
 
Private/Enterprise Test Networks 
- Private Ethereum networks allow parties or part of consortium, to share data without making it publicly accessible 
- Private blockchain is a good choice for sharing of sensitive data and scaling to handle higher read/write throughput 
- E.g., Quorum 
  - Developed by a consortium with [JP Morgan](https://www.jpmorgan.com/country/US/EN/Quorum)
 
[Ethereum Network Status Monitor](https://ethstats.net) 
- Check the health of the Ethereum network
- Must add your node to the network to be seen 
- Does not represent the full state of network 
- Shows Key Performance Indicators 
 
Local Test Network 
- Ethereum blockchain can be simulated locally for deployment 
- Local test networks process transactions instantly and Ether can be distributed as desired 
- Ethereum simulator 
- E.g., [Ganache](http://truffleframework.com/ganache) 

### 8.5 Ethereum Data Storage

Ethereum IPFS ([Inter-Planetary File System](https://ipfs.io))
- Peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol 
- Compare as a single BitTorrent swarm exchanging and sharing data through multiple computers storing the same file 
- IPFS is a versioned file system that can take files and manage them 
- IPFS will also store them somewhere and then tracks versions over time 
- IPFS accounts for how those files move across the blockchain network as in a distributed FS 
 
IPFS is a protocol 
- Defines a content-addressed file system 
- Coordinates content delivery 
- Combines Kademlia + BitTorrent + Git 
 
IPFS is a filesystem 
- With directories and files 
- Mountable filesystem (via FUSE) 
 
IPFS is a web 
- Can be used to view documents like the web 
- Files accessible via HTTP 
- Hash-addressed content guarantees authenticity 
- Browsers or extensions can learn to use the URL Scheme 
 
IPFS uses crypto 
- Cryptographic-hash content addressing 
- Block-level deduplication (remove redundancies in file structure) 
- File integrity + versioning 
- Filesystem-level encryption + signing support 
 
IPFS is P2P 
- Worldwide peer-to-peer file transfers 
- Completely decentralised architecture 
- No central point of failure (CPOF) 
 
IPFS is a CDN (Content-Delivery Network) 
- Add a file to the filesystem locally, and it's now available to the world 
- Caching-friendly 
- Bit-torrent-based bandwidth distribution 
  - Bit-Torrent is a distributed way to have media distributed where it's not centralised 
  - Bandwidth is optimised using a lot of bit-torrent's best practices and features 
 
IPFS has a name service, IPNS; An SFS inspired name system 
- Global namespace based on PKI 
- Serves to build trust chains 
- Compatible with other name service 
- Flexibility in namespace. 
  - E.g., can map DNS, .onion, .bit, etc. to IPNS.

### 8.8 Blockchain Forks and Segwits 

![img](img/8.8_01.png)

EVM is a Turning Complete virtual machine which meant that it is agile enough to run any code 
 
EVM runs on top of the hardware, which is an abstraction layer.  
- It has the hardware, so it can be any node on any network 
- EVM is broken down into consensus (the blockchain, the algorithm, updating the blockchain), the Whisper (messaging service to interact with other nodes), Swarm (act as storage, which is IPFS storage). 
- EVM is limited by gas, which meant that for developers to use the EVM, they need to have enough gas to power it. 
  - If they want to execute any kind of transactions, they need to make sure that their balance of gas is enough to complete that smart contract or DApps.  
- Mist browser allow us to access the DApps.

### 9.8 Technical Requirements

![img](img/9.8_01.png)

Functional requirements 
- General request by the user 
  - E.g., I want to be able to submit an expense or I want to view a report or I want to clear log files.  
- Functional requirements isn't very specific.  
  - Hence, technical requirements are the specific details that act as counterparts to functional requirements.  
- As a developer or solution architect, we have to look at functional requirement and ponder, how do we arrive from functional requirements to technical requirements? What do I need to do to execute this request?  
 
Technical requirements 
- Need to define tasks 
  - E.g., The technical requirement for how to submit expenses is I want to place an icon in the corner of my web screen or I want to place a link where the user can click to bring me to an application that will have me fill out a form.  
 
> So for the CBSA exam, what I want to make sure you understand is that the functional requirements drive the technical requirements and the technical requirements are actually what's going to define the tasks and the tasks then, once you define the tasks, you can get together your estimates of what you need, how much time it'll take to complete, any skill sets you may need, as well.  
 
> Your job as a Certified Blockchain Solutions Architect is to actually be able to define these requirements and then come up with the requirements and estimates, skill sets to successfully define a blockchain architecture. And for the exam, just remember the difference between functional and technical requirements. And that these are driven generally by the personas. 

### 9.9 Guiding Principles

![img](img/9.9_01.png)

Guiding Principles
- Guiding principles at a high level is about the agreement of your development team and the best practices on how to develop a blockchain solution 
- Agreement of team / Work together as a team 
  - Define what you're going to be working on 
  - How are you going to work on it 
  - What is the end game 
- Define persona 
  - A type of user and its user stories to help create functional requirements 
  - Functional requirements will help to define technical requirements 
 
Guiding principles act as a collection of best practices on how to go from start to finish when it comes to developing the blockchain architecture 

## L10: Ethereum Development Environment

# 10.1 Blockchain Testing 

Testing Ethereum Blockchain 
 
Ganache (formerly known as TestRPC) 
- Allows for testing and development with a local Blockchain simulation 
 
Truffle 
- A tool with a framework to release Blockchain application management system that allows for deployment and testing on Ethereum test and production Blockchains 
- Allow you to run multiple instances and see how it's going to run in your test environment and when you want to deploy it to MainNet 
 
Testing 
- When testing Ethereum apps, always follow the proper testing flow 
  - Local testing (e.g., laptop) > Test Network (e.g., Ropsten) > To Production (i.e., MainNet) 
- On Ethereum public Blockchain, make sure to use a tool such as Ganache (TestRPC) to test Smart Contracts locally before pushing to a test or production Blockchain 
- Agile Development 
  - Agile approach works well for pre-release but not for post-release / releasing to production 
    - Smart Contract is a permanent record on the Blockchain and cannot be removed once deployed 
    - Killing or calling a contract's self-destruct function (if implemented), will come with serious considerations. Hence, it is not recommended to continue an Agile cycle of continuous release and development once a contract is pushed to production 
      - We could kill the smart contract, but it is does not follow Agile best practices 

# 10.2 Truffle (Demo)

[Truffle](https://truffleframework.com)
- Package Management Framework that use Ethereum with 
- Developers often use it to integrates with Ganache 
- Goal of using a popular framework such as Truffle will help to create a pipeline and deploy software and test Smart Contracts in a fully integrated solution. 
- Install with NPM (Package Manager) 
- Truffle is development environment or development framework, that is used to create a pipeline to deploy Smart Contracts and test. This is commonly used with Ganache. 
 
https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/58093/difference-between-ganache-and-truffle/58096 

# 10.3 Ganache (Demo)

Ganache 
- When we use Truffle, we tend to prefer to use it with Ganache 
- Able to deploy a local personal Ethereum blockchain that can run commands and test out the environment that we're deploying, testing and running.
