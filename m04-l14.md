# 14.1 Hyperledger Design 

Hyperledger Fabric is a blockchain implementation that is designed for deploying a modular and extensible architecture. 
- It has a modular subsystem design so that different implementations can be plugged in and implemented over time. 
 
Modular and extensible 
- Modularity in all components of all frameworks 
  - Consensus layer 
  - Smart Contract layer 
  - Communication layer 
  - Data Store 
  - Identity Services (Root of Trust - to identify the participants) 
  - APIs 
  - And more components 
 
Interoperability 
- This principle is around backward interoperability and not focused on the interoperability between the various Hyperledger project-powered blockchain systems or business networks 
 
Secure Solutions 
- Enterprise and therefore business network security is paramount 
- The focus is on the interaction between components and the structure that governs the permissioning nature of permissioned blockchains 
 
Token or Cryptocurrency Agnostic 
- Hyperledger projects do not use crypto-assets, cryptocurrency, tokens, or coin-like constructs as incentive mechanics to establish trust systems. 
  - Can construct mechanisms to establish a trust between a system like Ripple or any other Cryptocurrency 
 
Rich APIs 
- The focus here is to ensure that blockchain systems have not only enterprise middleware access but instead access to business networks, existing participants and new systems without exposing the details of blockchain powered business networks. 
  - Not only do you have the enterprise middleware access, and the additional capabilities to extend your network and ecosystem 
 
Deploying Hyperledger Fabric 
- Hyperledger Fabric architecture can vary with each deployment due to its flexibility from modular architecture 
  - For a test and deploy environment, we might want to deploy two organisations, four perinodes and one certificate of authority and a solo auditor. 
- Production architecture should have a clustered CA and implement the correct number of orderer services 
- In a Hyperledger Fabric network, all the nodes should be clustered for availability, and all the block data and certification files should be backed up 
  - For best practices, whether it's Ethereum or Hyperledger, there are basics that we need to know such as availability, such as HA (High Availability), or fail over. 
    - Allow us to address any kind of issues in case an infrastructure go down in one area for other part to take over. 
- Production, test and development may want to be handled and design differently for each projects 
- Hyperledger Fabric is designed to be secure, but does not mean your deployment is automatically secure 
- Hyperledger Explorer can be used to interactively monitor the current Hyperledger Fabric network 

# 14.2 Hyperledger Fabric Design

Membership Services 
- This module is a permissioning module and act as a vehicle to establish a root of trust during network creation as this is instrumental in ensuring and managing the identity of members to determine who is going to access the blockchain 
 
Transactions 
- A transaction is a request to the blockchain to execute a function on the ledger 
- Function is implemented by a chaincode 
 
Smart Contract / Chaincode Services (Chaincode is an acronym for smart contract for Hyperledger) 
- Chaincode is an application-level code stored on the ledger as a part of a transaction 
- Chaincode runs transactions that may modify the world state 
- Transaction logic is written as chaincode (Go or JavaScript languages) and executes in secure Docker container 
- Chaincode is installed on peers, which require access to the asset states to perform reads and writes 

# 14.3 Hyperledger Playground 

Hyperledger Composer Playground 
- A tool which provides an environment that quickly model and test a blockchain network 
- [Composer](https://composer-playground.mybluemix.net/login) has a simple Graphical UI to edit and test the business blockchain network 
- Makes highly complex blockchain network easy for running blockchain testing 
- There is an online and offline version of Playground 
  - Online playground runs the business network in browser memory 
    - Convenient when you don't have the full downloaded blockchain or the full environment available 
  - Local playground is deployed in Hyperledger Fabric instances 
- Do you need the full Hyperledger Fabric instance or just enough to run in local memory 

# 14.4 Hyperledger Terminology

Block 
- An ordered set of transactions that is cryptographically linked to the preceding block(s) on a channel 
 
Chain 
- The ledger's chain is a transaction log structured as hash-linked blocks of transactions 
- Essentially sequence of the blockchain 
 
Chaincode (i.e., a Smart Contract in Ethereum) 
- A smart contract is code - invoked by a client application external to the blockchain network - that manages access and modifications to a set of key-value pairs in the World State 
 
Channel 
- Private blockchain overlay which allows for data isolation and confidentiality 
  - Instead of sending your transactions over the whole blockchain, we could set up a channel and delegate the transaction to only a specific node(s). 
- Channel-specific ledger that is shared across the peers in the channel, and transacting parties must be properly authenticated to a channel in order to interact with it 
 
Consensus 
- Broader term overarching the entire transactional flow, which serves to generate an agreement on the order and to confirm the correctness of the set of transactions constituting a block 
 
Endorsement 
- Process where specific peer nodes execute a chaincode transaction and return a proposal response to the client application 
  - Allow flexibility on executing chaincode 
 
Genesis Block 
- Configuration block that initialise the ordering service, or serve as the first block on a chain 
 
Gossip Protocol 
- The gossip data dissemination protocol performs three function 
  - Manages peer discovery and channel membership 
  - Disseminates ledger data across all peers on the channel 
  - Syncs ledger state across all peers on the channel 
 
State Database 
- Data is stored in a state database for efficient reads and queries from a chaincode 
  - Useful when want to increase performance or mitigate having to using the full blockchain  
- Supported databases include level DB and couchDB 
 
World State / Current state 
- A component of Hyperledger Fabric Ledger 
- Represents the latest values for all keys included in the chain transaction log 
- A specific snapshot at when the blockchain ledger is being looked at or reviewed
