Hyperledger Fabric is a permissioned enterprise blockchain, very modular with a lot of built-in capabilities with specific distinctions. 
- Two specific functions: Define and Invoke 
  - Users are able to deploy the code 
  - Invoke code by the transactions 
  - Able to deploy and invoke at the same time 
- Validation standpoint 
  - Entities are validators and could be the users as well 
  - Thus in Hyperledger, you can have validators and users
