# 5.1  Ethereum Basics

History - The total supply of ether and its rate of issuance was decided by the donations gathered on the 2014 presale of the currency 
- 60 million ether created for the contributors of the presale 
- 12 million (20% of the above) were created for the development fund (early contributors and developers) and the remaining for the Ethereum Foundation 
- 5 ethers are created every block (about 15 seconds) for the miner of the block 
- 2-3 ethers may be sent to the uncle (rewards) 
- Most widely used Open Source Blockchain-based distributed computing application platform 
- Mainly used for building and implementing smart contracts functionality 
- It offers a Decentralised Virtual Machine aka Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) 
- Initiated by Vitalik Buterin in 2013 
- Ethereum's live Blockchain was launched on 30 July 2015 

Definitions 
- Ether is the native token of the Ethereum blockchain which is used to pay for transaction fees, miner rewards and other services on the network 
- Ethereum is an open software platform based on blockchain technology that enables developers to write smart contracts and build and deploy decentralised applications 

Ethereum has four main components 
- Nodes 
- Ethereum Virtual Machines 
- Smart Contracts 
- dApps 

Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) 
- Built into software running on the Ethereum protocol. It executes smart contracts (Ethereum programs written in the Solidity language) 
- The EVM is contained in the full nodes of the Ethereum network, inside of which it executes these Ethereum-user-written programs (smart contracts) 

EVM Code 
- EVM code is the programming language in which accounts on the Ethereum blockchain can contain code 
- The EVM code associated with an account is executed every time a message is sent to that account, and has the ability to read/write storage and itself send messages 

Gas 
- Measurement roughly equivalent to computational steps for Ethereum 
- Every transaction is required to include a gas limit and a fee that it is willing to pay per gas; miners have the choice of including the transaction and collecting the fee or not 
- Every operation has a gas expenditure on an EVM 

Ethereum 
- The Ethereum blockchain is a transaction-based state machine 
- In computer science, a state machine refers to something that will read a series of inputs and based on those inputs, will transition to a new state 
- Genesis State is the beginning state and then to the final state 
- For a transaction to be considered valid, it has to be processed by a validation process known as blockchain mining 
- Mining is when a group of nodes use their computing resources to create a block of valid transactions 

# 5.2 Ethereum Architecture

Ethereum Architecture 
- When designing or architecting your blockchain, there are some key areas to focus on 
- Private or Public dApps 
- Global Scaling 
- APIs 
- Smart Contract 
- User Interface 

The Ethereum protocol design process follows a number of principles. These principles are all involved in guiding Ethereum development, but they are not absolute 
- Sandwich Complexity Model 
  - Essentially like a three tier development best practice scenario to limit your complexity 
    - Top: User interface
    - Middle: Programming and Development
    - Bottom: Smart contract 
  - Avoid complexity by having the top and the bottom to be as simple, whereas the middle is to introduce your complexity. 
- Freedom 
  - Not limiting what you can do in Ethereum from a development standpoint 
  - If want to add additional capabilities or restrict, it's possible and up to us 
- Generalisation 
  - An approach where the development best practices is to make things as low layer as possible without restricting anything or making things too simplistic 
- We Have No Features 
  - Motto of Ethereum to make the platform as robust as possible 
    - Without worry about design features into it 
    - Modular 
- Non-risk-aversion 
  - Want to take risk instead of averting risk if it is totally not necessary 
- https://ethereumbuilders.gitbooks.io/guide/content/en/design_rationale.html 

Ethereum attends to the principals well by building what is essentially the ultimate abstract foundational layer 
- A blockchain with a built-in Turing complete programming language 
- Solidity is similar to Javascript 

Ethereum Architecture is built for both decentralisation and for distribution of content, processing etc.
