# 7.1 Ethereum Tokens 

When providing value, tokens is a good way to enable the platform to be able to provide value to users 

Ethereum Tokens 
- Ether is the native token of the Ethereum blockchain which is used to pay for transaction fees, miner rewards and other services on the network.  
- Using the Ethereum network requires you to pay for the privilege with gas 

Two Types of Tokens 
- Usage Tokens 
  - These are tokens in specific blockchain that are similar to their own native currency in their Dapps 
  - E.g., Golem or a gaming platform 

Work Tokens 
- These are the tokens that identify you as a sort of shareholder in the Dapps
- As a shareholder, you generally have some voting rights 
- E.g., Dash where you would possess tokens and have voting rights 

ERC20 defines a common list of protocols that an Ethereum token has to implement. 
- Allows developers to program behaviour of new tokens within the Ethereum ecosystem 
  - Common with crowdfunding companies via Initial Coin Offerings 

Coin Swap
- Change the current token to a new version token after an ICO

# 7.2 Ethereum Smart Contracts

The main value that Ethereum provides to organisations is the fact that you could write and implement smart contracts 

Smart Contracts 
- Describe computer program code that is capable of facilitating, executing and enforcing the negotiation or performance of an agreement using blockchain technology (Contract) 
- Entire process is automated and can act as a complement, or substitute for legal contracts 
- Terms of smart contract are recorded in a computer language as a set of instructions 
- Define the rules and penalties around an agreement in the same way that a traditional contract does 
- Automatically enforce those obligations 
- Several smart contracts can make up a DApps 

Smart Contracts provide: 
- Autonomy 
- Trust 
- Backup 
- Safety 
- Speed 
- Savings 
- Accuracy 

Type of Functions which are required in a smart contract 
- Constructor Function 
  - Function which is called only once when deploying smart contract 
    - E.g., used to receive the initial Ether sent to it at time of deployment 
- Fallback Function 
  - Function is essentially without a name and generally defined as a function in a code. 
    - E.g., (defined as function (){codeâ€¦})  
  - Invoked when someone sends Ether to the address of your smart contract.  
  - If this function is not programmed, Ether sent to the smart contract will be rejected 

Smart Contracts 
- Provide security that is better than traditional contracts 
- Cut transactional costs associated with traditional contracting 
- Smart contracts on Ethereum network run on Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) [A Turing-based machine] 
- The Decentralised Applications (DApps) running on the Ethereum network are basically complex Smart Contracts 

Smart Contracts Enforcement 
- Basics of Ethereum states that all modifications to a contract's data must be performed by its code 
- Modification of a contract's data requires a blockchain user to send requests to its code. This process kickoff determines whether and how to fulfill those requests. 
- A traditional database uses an enforced stored procedure 
  - Think of this approach as predefined rules in blockchain

Smart Contracts Legal Enforcement 
- Smart Contracts may not be legally enforceable, especially across borders or jurisdictions 
- Could be used as evidence 
- Think of a vending machine where you put in the required funds to get the drinks or food 

# 7.3 Smart Contract Workflow

![img](img/7.3_01.png)

A smart contract is code that has been written to execute when conditions are met. 
- A contract has to have specific terms and currency conditions set. 
  - Has the money been sent? Is it the right amount? What about the timing? Or any other conditions. 
- As long as conditions are met, this mean that events will be triggered / events has been met. 
- Contracts will execute when all the terms are met. 
- Once the contract has executed, then the contract has been settled. 

The smart contract workflow can be done in several different ways to settle contracts 
- On-chain 
  - It is on the blockchain 
- Off-chain 
  - It could be sent to a payment gateway or another cryptocurrency gateway or blockchain.
