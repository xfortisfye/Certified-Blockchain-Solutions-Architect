#### L04: Blockchain Use Cases

# 4.1 Business Use Cases and Models

A business model describes the rationale of how an organisation creates, delivers, and captures value in economic, social, cultural, or other contexts. 

E.g.,
- Business-to-Business (B2B) 
- Business-to-Consumer (B2C) 

- Consumer-to-Consumer (C2C) 
- Consumer-to-Business (C2B) 
- Business-to-Government (B2G) 
- Government-to-Business (G2B) 
- Government-to-Citizen (G2C) 

Blockchain Technology is already disrupting 
- Financial Services, Government Services, Healthcare, Real Estate and other industries on smaller scale 

Blockchain Technology is already evolving to where an organisation has to consider its effects to the business model in three main ways: 
- Technical 
- Business 
- Legal 

Use of Blockchain technology in several industries is affecting how services are delivered and how many people are involved in the delivery of that service 
- E.g., if you are a large financial organisation, and you do a lot of international transfers, it helps to rule out accountants, attorneys and intermediaries that are involved in the transfer. 
- Essentially a "disruption" in the business model is occurring. 

# 4.2 Blockchain Use Cases - G2C

- Dubai is not the only government investing in blockchain. 
- However they clearly are one of the more visible and [heavily invested](https://www.the-blockchain.com/2017/02/16/smart-dubai-office-sdo-1776-launch-blockchain-challenge/). 
- Dubai aims to be a pioneer in the adoption of emerging technologies such as Blockchain, which it recognizes has a major potential to transform city services 
- Dubai is investing in the Smart Dubai Office (SDO) and 1776 Launch Blockchain Challenge 

Dubai Blockchain strategy is based on three pillars 
- Government Efficiency 
  - Implementing Blockchain technology in government services 
- Industry Creation 
  - Supporting the creation of a Blockchain industry through empowering startups and businesses 
- Thought Leadership 
  - Leading the global thinking on Blockchain technology 

Dubai Blockchain strategy benefits 
- Dubai's adoption of blockchain technology at a city-wide scale is a testament to its commitment to positively transform government from service provider to service enabler 
- "We believe blockchain technology. With its built-in efficiency, accountability and security, blockchain holds a key to achieving our vision." 

# 4.3 Blockchain Use Cases - B2C

B2C Use Case 
- A Business-to-Consumer (B2C) is business or transactions conducted directly between a company and consumers who are the end-users of its products or services. 
- Services being provided to the consumer is an area of interest to the company 
- Consumers increasingly want more transparency in the services and products they purchases 
- Some area of focus 
  - Food Supply Traceability 
  - Resource Procurement 
  - Labor 
  - Logistics 
  - Compliance
- Verticals that are heavily exploring blockchain for transparency are 
  - Financials 
  - Logistics 
  - Charity Funding 
  - Agriculture Tracking 
  - Precious Metals 
  - Numerous other Verticals 

The jewelry industry has been known for fraud, child labor issues, false metal mining and a clear lack of transparency. 
- Precious metals consortium with IBM has established a blockchain initiative around how transparency can be brought to the consumer 
- The "TrustChain Initiative" tracks and authenticates diamonds and precious metals through every stage of the supply chain as it becomes a piece of finished jewelry. 
- The collaboration's goal is to instill trust in the origin and ethical sourcing of jewelry by bringing together a community of responsible and ethical organisations across the complex and multi-tiered jewelry supply chain. 
- Consumers will see that "TrustChain" establishes a trusted product with documented provenance and brings together quality assurance, social and environmental responsibility and authenticity spanning the entire jewelry ecosystem - From miners, manufacturers, wholesale suppliers and retailers - on a single digital platform. 

Benefits to the consumers from a blockchain solution is clear and established 
- Transparency to the consumers 
- Responsibility from the suppliers 
- Ethical Sourcing validation 
- Labor Verification 
- Immutable shared view

# 4.4 Common Use Cases for Cryptocurrency

- It is important to note whether to use permissioned or permissionless blockchains due to different use cases 
- Part of the use case may require a cryptocurrency or use of a token 
- Blockchain serve as the basis technology in which cryptocurrencies are a part of the ecosystem 
- They go hand-in-hand, and cryptocurrency is often necessary to transact on a permissionless blockchain 
  - Blockchains that are cryptocurrencies are the tokens used within these networks to send value and pay for these transactions 
  - They can be used to digitize value of an asset as well 
  - E.g., Bitcoin, Litecoin and Monero 

- Blockchains that are private for an enterprise don't generally need a cryptocurrency 
  - Private or Private Chain (Permissioned) 
  - E.g., Hyperledger, R3 Corda 

- A blockchain does not require cryptocurrency, but a cryptocurrency requires blockchain 
- The use case for cryptocurrency is more for permissionless blockchain instead of private/permissioned blockchain 

# 4.5 Database vs Blockchain Architecture

Legacy Architectures in Database 
- SQL or NoSQL 
- Whether centralised or distributed 
- Traditional databases use client-server network architectures 
- Database processing is quicker 
- Traditional databases use client-server network architecture 
- Control of the database remains with a designated authority (Require database administrator) 
- If security of the authority is compromised, then the data can be modified or even deleted 
- CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete). More flexible than blockchain. 

Database maintain 
- Disintermediation 
- Centralisation 
- Performance 
- Agility 
- Privacy 

Blockchain allows for two specific function: 
- Validation of a transaction 
- Writing of a new transaction 

Blockchain Properties: 
- Trustlessness 
  - Network participants help secure the network so there is no need for a centralised third party to be employed 
- Replication 
  - Blockchain stores a copy on every computer in the network 
- Immutable 
  - Once a piece of information is appended to the blockchain, it can never be edited 
- Timestamp 
  - A timestamp is a sequence of characters or encoded information identifying when a certain event occurs 
- Atomicity 
  - Either all of the operations in a transaction execute successfully and take the system to a different consistent state or nothing happens at all 
- Consistency
  - Integrity constraints must be maintained so that the database is consistent before and after the transaction 
- Isolation 
  - Multiple transactions can occur concurrently without leading to inconsistency of database state 
- Durability 
  - Once the transaction has completed execution, the updates and modifications to the database are written to disk 

# 4.6 Blockchain as a Service

Blockchain as a Service (BaaS) 
- Generally deployed on a Cloud Computing solution 
- Develop, test and deploy secure blockchain apps 
- Nodes are setup by provider 
- Proof-of-Concepts (POC) 
  - Use BaaS to enable a POC. For E.g, to deploy our own Ethereum and create custom deployment of it, we are able to test BaaS on Amazon or Azure to test if it fits requirements 
- No need for CAPEX or OPEX for management of infrastructure 

BaaS Providers 
- MS Azure 
- AWS 
- IBM 
- Stratis 
- HPE 
- Oracle 

- IBM supports Hyperledger very well. 
- Azure and AWS supports Ethereum differently. 

# 4.7 Cost Modelling 

One of the challenges when defining a blockchain, is the cost that is involved. 
Organisation uses two ways to fund projects. 

CAPEX
- Large expenditures that require signatures from executives, Board of Directors. 
- Goes through procurement in a lot of places 
- Takes longer time to process 

OPEX 
- Operational funds that are distributed to the organisation 
- Usually small amount of money to pay for subscriptions or training or day-to-day expenses 
- Does not need to go through CAPEX expenditures (getting approval from executives or BoD or procurement in lot of places) 

CAPEX is larger amount of money while OPEX is smaller amount of money. 

Areas of Cost Modelling 
- Procurement Process 
  - How are we going to go to provide a solution to the customer (CAPEX or OPEX?) 
    - Talk to point-of-contact, customer, client to better understand 
- Procurement Effectiveness 
  - How long will it take to occur 
  - OPEX can process procurements quickly 
  - CAPEX will process procurement much longer 
- Benchmarking 
  - How long is it going to take the solution from its infancy to deployment 
- Cost/Timelines 
- Pricing Strategy 
  - For blockchain
