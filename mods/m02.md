# M2 Basics of Blockchain

## L02: Blockchain and Cryptocurrency 

### 2.1 History of Blockchain

Blockchain History
- It is important to review the people who inhabit Yap Island and their unique currency called Rai Stones
- These stones could not be physically traded so the Yapese people used mental ledgers where all tribe members kept a copy of the ledger in their head
- First known use of a ledger

Byzantine Generals Problem
- The problem: Number of general (from same army) have surrounded a walled city on all sides
- Balance of power is such that if all generals attack at the same time, they will take the city
- The challenge: If general are not coordinated in their attack, they will lose the city and their campaign
- The solution: Use cryptography to encrypt messages
- Provides mathematical computation power
- Ensures privacy
- In 2008, a whitepaper is published by Satoshi Nakamoto which outlines a solution to the Byzantine Generals problem
- Bitcoin was started and thus the cryptocurrency launched in 2009

History
- Bitcoin uses a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus algo
- Work must be provided to solve the problem
- Bitcoin was the original solution to the BFT problem

Blockchain Release Date
- 2009: Bitcoin
- 2015: Ethereum
- 2015: Hyperledger

### 2.2 What is a Blockchain

Blockchain Basics
- Cryptographically secure, shared, distributed ledger
- Immutable transactions are written on this distributed ledger on distributed nodes
- Transformational technology in which business and government invest in
- It's a decentralised database which stores information in the form of transactions
- Blockchains are similar to a book that can be written to but not erased
   - Book = Blockchain
   - Page = Block
   - Page Entry = Blockchain Transaction
- Blockchains can be private or public
- Blockchains are a revolutionary way of implementing trust into a platform
- Blockchain is a globally shared data structure, transactional backend database (In Bitcoin, it's generally called a ledger)
   - Everyone can read entries in the database just by participating in the network
   - To change something in the database, you have to create a so-called transaction which has to be accepted by all other
   - Transaction implies that the change you want to make (assume you want to change two values at the same time) is either not done at all or completely applied
- Compare blockchain to other technology
   - Telcom network to a telephone
   - Databases are centralised where the blockchain is decentralised
   - Blockchains are not built from a new technology. They are built from a unique syncing of three existing technologies
		
Blockchain Technologies
- P2P networks
- Private Key Encryption
- Programs

Blockchain Digital Identity
- Digital Identity is established
   - Combining a public and private key creates a strong digital identity reference based on possession
	
Blockchain Revolution
- Blockchain is revolutionary in several ways
   - Blockchain is not a new technology but a synching of technologies that now make sense
   - Trust is at the center and essentially removes intermediaries (efficiency)
   - Tamperproof public ledger of value
   - Disruptive to the status quo. Legacy is out
   - Platform with numerous use cases

Blockchain Review
- Blockchain is a complex technology but is a simple concept really. Trust is at the center
   - Blockchains are ledgers shared among computers around the world
   - The ledgers in a blockchain are immutable

### 2.3 Blockchain Ledgers

Blockchain Ledgers
-  Consensus is when the distributed ledger has been updated and all nodes maintain their own identical copy of the ledger
-  This architecture allows for a new capacity as a system of recordkeeping that goes beyond being a simple database
-  A ledger is an append-only record store, where records are immutable and may hold more general information than financial records
-  A distributed ledger is a database that stored and updated independently by each node in the blockchain
  - Decentralised and distributed nature is what makes it unique
  - In blockchain, they are immutable
  - Every single node on the network processes every transaction that occurs

### 2.4 Blockchain Components

Blockchain Key Components
-  Cryptography
-  P2P Network
-  Shared Digital Ledger
-  Consensus Algorithm
-  Validity Rules
-  Virtual Machines

Cryptography
-  Cryptography for transactions
-  Recorded, encrypted and secured between peers in blockchain
-  No need for a centralised authority
	
P2P Network
-  P2P Network connects the blockchain nodes
-  All computers share responsibility on the network
-  Workloads are shared

Shared Digital Ledger
-  Shared Digital Ledger is a data structure managed inside the node application
-  Distributed Database held and updated independently by each participant (or node) in a large network

The Consensus Algorithm
-  The Consensus algorithm is implemented as part of the node application for how the ecosystem comes to a single view of the ledger
-  Different ecosystems have different methods for attaining consensus
-  Determines method for world state (view of the blockchain and its status)

Validity Rules
-  Validity Rules (validation) state how the user and the transactions will be validated

Virtual Machine
-  Virtual Machines are a representation of a server created by a computer program and operated with instructions embodied in a language
-  Ethereum and Bitcoin uses VMS
-  E.g., The virtual machine lives in the Ethereum node applications

### 2.5 Blockchain Permission (Private) or Permissionless (Public)

Blockchain Architectures
- Originally developed as permissionless (E.g., BTC)
- Public Blockchain, Open Blockchain, Permissionless
- Private Blockchain, Closed Blockchain, Permissioned, Enterprise Blockchain
- Ethereum is Permissionless, Hyperledger is Permissioned
- Enterprise prefer Private for security and performance

![img](img/2.5_01.png)

![img](img/2.5_02.png)

Considerations on private vs public blockchain
- Governance (Generally preferred private blockchain)
- Industry Vertical (Financial logistics -> Private BC, Social Media -> Public BC such as Ethereum)
- Smart Contract Functionality (Private BC such as Hyperledger has flexibility with smart contract unlike ripple. Public BC such as Ethereum is more suitable.
- Cryptocurrency Requirement
- Consensus Algorithm
- Costing Model (Private more expensive as supporting own nodes)
- Integration (BC to an enterprise application, Application Support, Developer integration)
- Transaction Performance
- Trust
- Transparency
- Privacy
- Security

### 2.6 Blockchain Considerations

| | Ethereum | Hyperledger |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Industry | Cross-Industry | Cross-Industry |
| Ledger | Permissionless | Permissioned |
| Consensus | POW | Pluggable Architecture |
| Smart Contracts | Yes | Yes |
| Coin/Token | Yes | No |

- Understand the industry that the blockchain is going to serve. 
  - Ethereum and Hyperledger are both considered to be cross-industry blockchains 
  - Ripple (more focused on financial industry) 
- Cross-industry 
  - Able to integrate it with your specific enterprise vertical 
    - Hyperledger can be used for EDI or logistics 
- Ledger 
  - Ethereum is for open blockchain approach 
  - Hyperledger is for enterprise 
- Consensus 
  - How it affects performance 
- Smart Contracts 
  - Does your blockchain support smart contract 
- Coin/Token 
  - Ethereum has native cryptocurrency such as Ether 
  - Hyperledger has no native cryptocurrency or token 

### 2.7 Trust or Trustless Blockchain 

Trust Blockchain 
- Establishing Trust In Blockchain 
  - Essentially transferring trust from an intermediary to technology  
  - Storing data in blockchain through cryptography functions 
  - All transaction data on the BC is assumed to be trustworthy 
  - Data has not been tampered with 
  - Blockchain is immutable (can't be deleted or modified) 

Trustless Blockchain 
- What is trustless in Blockchain 
  - Trustless as it is a model that does not require trust to safely interact and transact a deed or purchase 
  - Trustless blockchain is a transfer of trust to technology from organizations (Banks, Government, Corporations) 
  - Built on premise that "transparent code" essentially removes the need for intermediaries (technology) 
  - Smart contracts essentially reduce the need for accountants, lawyers, bankers etc as trust is formed. 
  - Financial transparency can result through the use of blockchains and thus reduce the need for intermediaries 
  - Ledger act as a trust broker when two parties don't trust each other 

### 2.8 Blockchain Forks and Segwits 

Forks 
- Fork is a change to the software of the digital currency that creates two separate versions of the blockchain with a shared history (One Dominant) 
- Can be permanent or temporary 
- Snapshot date where a snapshot of the ledger is captured 
- The snapshot happens at a block number and a new currency is a result (Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin and Litecoin Cash) 

Hard Fork (Major Upgrade) 
- A hard fork describe a major change to the blockchain protocol which makes previously blocks invalid or transactions valid. 
- Can be used to keep the same coin with major changes to the blockchain or to create a new coin 
- Requires all nodes to upgrade to the latest version of the protocol software if they want to use the new coin or blockchain 

Soft Fork (Minor Upgrade) 
- A change that is backward compatible. Instead of 1MB blocks, new rule might only allow 500k blocks 
- A small feature or a capability that has essentially change 
- A change to the software protocol where only previously valid blocks/transactions are made invalid 
- Soft forks need a majority of hash power in the network 

Soft Fork vs Hard Fork
| Soft Fork | Hard Fork |
| --- | --- |
| Tightening the rules (E.g., 1MB -> 0.5MB) | Expanding the rules (E.g., 1MB -> 2MB) |
| Backwards compatible | Not backwards compatible |
| Old nodes accept new blocks | Old nodes don't accept new blocks |

Hard Fork Examples 
- Ethereum Classic is a split from an existing cryptocurrency Ethereum after a hard fork. 
- Monero is a hard-fork to introduce an upgrade to its network by implementing a feature called Ring Confidential Transactions (RCT) to improve its privacy and security 
- Bitcoin Cash is a hard fork orchestrated by a portion of the community that wanted Bitcoin to scale by increasing its block size from the current 1MB to 8MB 
 
Soft Fork Examples 
- BIP 66: Soft Fork on Bitcoin's signature validation 
- P2SH: Soft Fork that enabled multi-signature addresses in Bitcoin's network 
 
Segwit (Segregated Witness) 
- Separate transaction signatures 
- Removes signatures. 
- Create efficiency of transactions by removing signatures to free up capacity to add more transactions to the chain 
- Increases security threats by removing digital signatures 
- Improves scalability issue (UTX0) 
- Reduces transaction times by skipping calculation for signatures 
- Enables off-chain protocols (P2SH256) 
- Improve transaction security by reducing malleability (ability to be shaped) (transaction malleability) 
 

### 2.9 Comparing Crypto Currency vs Blockchain 

Cryptocurrency 
- Digital currencies are secured using cryptography and combining that with their role as a currency 
- Mined, not printed 
- Considered as digital gold, digital silver 
- E.g., Bitcoin, Litecoin, Monero, Dash, Ether, Ripple 
 
Initial Coin Offering 
- An event in which new cryptocurrency sells advance tokens from its overall coinbase in exchange for upfront capital 
- ICOs are frequently used to help developers raise capital

![img](img/2.9_01.png)

Differences between Cryptocurrency and Blockchain 
- Blockchain is the platform / Blockchain is the enabler 
- Cryptos like Bitcoin uses the blockchain platform / Cryptocurrency uses Blockchain Technology 
- Bitcoin is the first known software (token) for blockchain 
- Platform vs Application 
- BTC is a P2P cryptocurrency that uses the P2P platform (Blockchain) 
- Ethereum is a platform, Ether is the Cryptocurrency 
 
Analogy 
- Blockchain is the train track (Platforms are the enabler) 
- Cryptos are the trains on the track (Applications are enabled)

### 2.10 Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 

Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 
- BIP is a design document for introducing features or information to Bitcoin 
- BIP should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature 
- Standard way of communicating ideas since Bitcoin has no formal structure 
- Any developer or anyone from anywhere in the world can propose a BIP 
- Whole Bitcoin community of users, miners, developers and investors to vote on it 
 
Three Major Types of BIPs 
- Standard tracks 
- Informational 
- Process 

Standard Track BIPs 
- Entail making changes to the network protocol, block or transaction validation method 
- It intends to affect the interoperability of the two versions of BIPs or Bitcoin 
- Requires community consensus (E.g., BIP 91) 
 
Informational BIPs 
- Highlight design issues, general guidelines and supporting information 
- E.g., BIP 32 
 
Process BIPs 
- Describe or propose a change in the process 
- Similar to Standard Track BIP and require community consensus 
- E.g., BIP 2 

### 2.11 Cryptocurrency Wallet

Wallet 
- A program which allows you to gain access to send, and receive bitcoins on the blockchain 
- Several types of bitcoin wallets: Hardware, Software, Web 

Software Wallet 
- Programs that you download and run on personal computer 

Web Wallet 
- Hosted on website of a company which provides bitcoin wallet services 
- Wallets are easier to set up and use, but have to rely on hosting company to provide sufficient security measures, which can sometimes be a dangerous trade off  
- Coinbase is an online exchange that is hosted in US 

Hardware Wallet 
- Maintains high levels of security to protect your coins by storing your coins offline 
- Offline storage keeps your coins out of reach from hackers because they are not on the Internet 
- Cost is more expensive than a software or web wallet 
 
Paper Wallet 
- Offline wallet and is considered the safest type 
- Just a printout 
 
Wallet Security 
- Restrict unsupervised accessed. Strong passwords and close all ports and maintain a strict firewall 
- Frequently change address. Use a different address for every transaction 
- Multiple Signatures. Multiple private keys to deter breaches. 
 
Ethereum Wallets 
- E.g., Metamask, Myetherwallet, Jaxx (multi-cryptocurrency wallet) 

### 2.12 Value Creation 

Value Creation of Blockchain Technology 
- Costing 
- Security 
- Privacy 
- Efficiency (Remove Intermediaries) 
- Open source 
 
Value Creation of Blockchain Technology with Tokens 
- Tokens are used as a store of value as entries on a blockchain ledger 
- You own these tokens because you have a key that lets you create a new entry on the ledger, re-assigning the ownership to someone else 
- You don't store tokens on your computer; you store the keys that let you reassign the quantity 
- These are digital resources that you control and can reassign control to someone else 
 
Value Creation of Blockchain Technology with Smart Contracts 
- Smart Contracts is a computer program code that is capable of facilitating, executing, and enforcing the negotiation or performance of an agreement using Blockchain technology 
- Entire process is automated and it can act as a complement or substitute for legal contracts, where the terms of the smart contract are recorded in a computer language as a set of instructions 
- Are not legally enforceable 
- Provide autonomy, trust, backup (immutable), safety, speed, savings (no need for intermediaries), accuracy (removing human factor)

### 2.13 Ethereum Denominations 

| Unit | Wei | Wei |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Wei | 1wei | 1 | 
| Kwei | 1e3wei | 1,000 | 
| Mwei | 1e6wei | 1,000,000 | 
| Gwei (Shannon) | 1e9wei | 1,000,000,000 |

| Ether | 1e18wei | 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 | 

Ether can be broken down into smaller units. 
Gwei is known as Shannon, MilliEther is known as Finney.

Ethstats.net 
- Tell number of active node 
- Gas price 
- Gas limit 
- Uncle Count 
- Transactions 
- Gas Spending 

### 2.16 Blockchain Decision Path 

Factors to decide which kind of blockchain to use (Permissioned or Permissionless) 
1) Database 
2) Multiple Organisation/People 
3) Trusted 
4) Uniform Rules 
5) Immutable 
6) Frequent TX 
7) Transparency 
8) Security 
9) Compliance 
 
- Ethereum is cheaper than Hyperledger 
- Ethereum is permissionless/public whereas Hyperledger is Permissioned/Privated.

## L03: Blockchain Consensus Algo

### 3.1 What is a Consensus Algo

Consensus is a dynamic way of reaching agreement in a group 
- In contrast, voting just settles for a majority rule without any thought for the feelings and well-being of the minority 
- Hence, consensus makes sure that an agreement is reached which could benefit the entire group as a whole. 
 
Example of BC Algos: 
- Proof of Work 
- Proof of Stake 
- Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) 
- Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) 
- Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) 

### 3.2 What Is Mining

Bitcoin Mining 
- In Bitcoin, mining is the process of adding transaction records to Bitcoin's public ledger 
- This ledger of past transactions is called the blockchain as it is a chain of blocks 
- The blockchain serves to confirm transactions to the rest of the network as completed 
- Bitcoin nodes use the blockchain to distinguish legitimate Bitcoin transactions from attempts to re-spend coins that have already been spent. 

Bitcoin mining is called so because it resembles the mining of other commodities. 
- Requires exertion and it slowly makes new currency available at a rate that resembles the rate at which commodities like gold are mined from the ground 
- Bitcoin uses the Hashcash proof of work algorithm 
- A reward is given when a block is discovered, the discoverer may award themselves a certain number of bitcoins, which is agreed-upon by everyone in the network 
- Currently this bounty is 25 bitcoins, but this value will halve every 210,000 blocks 
- The miner is awarded the fees paid by users sending transactions (Miners could receive the transaction fee which could be significant) 

- The fee is an incentive for the miner to include the transaction in their block 
 
Example of BC Algos: 
- Proof of Work 
- Proof of Stake 
- Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) 
- Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) 
- Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) 
 
Proof of Work 
- First blockchain consensus algorithm 
- Saotshi Nakamoto created for the BC blockchain 
- PoW miners solve hard problems to create blocks 
- PoW runs on a system of "the longest chain wins" 
- Expensive, both in terms of cost and environments 
- E.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin 
 
Proof of Stake 
- Blocks aren't created by miners doing work 
- Blocks are created by minters staking their tokens to "bet" on which blocks are valid  
- In the case of a fork, minters spend their tokens voting on which fork to support 
- Attacks costly but more environmental 
E.g., Peercoin, Dash, Ethereum (in the future) 
 
Delegated Proof-of-Stake 
- Miners can collaborate to make blocks instead of competing like in PoW and PoS 
- By partially centralizing the creation of blocks, DPoS can run orders much faster than most other algorithms 
- Cheaper transaction, faster and centralised 
- E.g., Steemit and EOS 
 
Byzantine Fault Tolerance 
- Classic problem is distributed computing and is explained with Byzantine generals 
- Pre-selected generals and meant for a private blockchain. 
- PBFT runs incredibly efficiently 
- High transaction throughput, but centralised/permission based 
- E.g., Hyperledger, Ripple and Stellar 
 
Directed Acyclic Graphs 
- DAGs are a form of consensus that doesn't use the blockchain data strcture and handles transactions mostly asynchronously. 
- The plus is theoretically infinite transactions per second (Don't have the nodes or the blockchain that slows down the transaction per second) 
- E.g., IOTA, Hashgraph

### 3.3 Proof-Of-Work (PoW)

Proof of Work 
- First blockchain consensus algorithm 
- Saotshi Nakamoto created for the BC blockchain 
- PoW miners solve hard problems to create blocks 
- PoW runs on a system of "the longest chain wins" 
- Expensive, both in terms of cost and environments 
- E.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin 
 
- Goal of proof of work is to solve the problem; a race. Whoever solves the problem first, gets the reward. 
- Ethereum still uses proof-of-work.  
- Depending on release of Ethereum, homestead version of Ethereum uses Ethash which is another PoW consensus algo. 

### 3.4 Proof-of-Stake (PoS)

Proof of Stake 
- Blocks aren't created by miners doing work 
- Blocks are created by minters staking their tokens to "bet" on which blocks are valid  
- In the case of a fork, minters spend their tokens voting on which fork to support 
- Attacks costly but more environmental 
E.g., Peercoin, Dash, Ethereum (in the future) 

### 3.5 Compare PoW and PoS

| | PoW (Mines) | PoS (Stakes) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Blocks by mining | Yes | No |
| Speed | Slower TPS | Faster TPS |
| Rewards | Yes | Yes/No |
| Costing | Expensive | Cost Efficient |
| Example | BTC, Ether, LTC | Stratis, Pivix, Dash (Hybrid) |

- PoW is uses large amount of memory, TPUs, and Essex and specialised computer chips to process and mine cryptocurrencies. 
- PoS is not as intensive and generally have entities or organisations or even individuals putting up a monetary contribution in tokens to be able to participate in that blockchain as a minor. Proof of Stake is really a combination or could be hybrid or could be not really mining it all, it's more of a betting process. 
 
- Pivix is a hybrid of dash but dash uses the combination of PoW and PoS. 

### 3.6 Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) 

Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) 
- Miners can collaborate to make blocks instead of competing like in PoW and PoS 
- By partially centralizing the creation of blocks, DPoS can run orders much faster than most other algorithms 
- Cheaper transaction, faster and centralised 
- E.g., Steemit and EOS 
 
- Divides the consensus model in two fundamental parts 
  - Electing a group of block producers 
  - Scheduling production 
- Not everyone in a DPoS network can produce blocks to validate a transaction 
- Participants who hold token can cast votes to elect block producers 
- Voters are weighted by voter's stake. The block producer candidates that receive the most votes are those who produce blocks 
- In DPoS, you can think as stakeholders, notaries, block producers and witnesses 
 
Benefits 
- Separation of concerns where participants can be grouped appropriately, and mining and token control can be controlled better 
- Stakeholder (Token) control 
- Scalability to restrict the number of participants 
- On chain governance (Allow where to control where the network, nodes, participants are to comply to regulation) 
- Avoid "Nothing at stake" problem in which a small group of validators can take control of the network 
  - The fixed number of token validators in DPoS as well as the dynamic election model prevents this issues from happening 

### 3.7 Byzantine Fault Tolerance 

Byzantine Fault Tolerance 
- Classic problem is distributed computing and is explained with Byzantine generals 
- Pre-selected generals and meant for a private blockchain. 
- PBFT runs incredibly efficiently 
- High transaction throughput, but centralised/permission based 
- E.g., Hyperledger, Ripple and Stellar 
 
Byzantine General Problem state that no two node on a decentralised network can entirely and irrefutably guarantee that they are displaying the same data. 
- Satoshi Nakamoto solved the issue with BTC PoW Consensus Algo. 
- Essentially a "Byzantine" node is a node that can be rogue by not forwarding packets or perhaps mislead other nodes involved in the P2P Consensus network.  

### 3.8 Other Blockchain Consensus Algo

Proof of Elapsed Time (Proprietary Algorithm) 
- Created by Intel to run on their trusted execution environment  
- Similar to Proof-of-Work but more energy efficient 
- Major issue: Requires trust in Intel, places power back in the hands of a central authority 
- Good Solution in cases where we are able to trust an authority such as Intel. 
 
Proof of Authority 
- Uses a set of "authorities" - Nodes that are explicitly allowed to create new blocks and secure the blockchain 
- Replacement for PoW (Private blockchains only) 
- Earn the right to become a validator/authority 

Proof of Burn 
- Coins are "burned" by sending them to an address where they cannot be retrieved 
- The more coins you burn, the better your chances of being selected to mine the next block. 
- Eventually, you must stake more by burning more coins. 
 
Proof of Activity 
- Hybrid of PoW and PoS 
- Empty template blocks are mined (PoW), then filed with transactions which are validated via Proof-of-Stake 
- Similar to Dash. 
 
Proof of Capacity 
- Pay to play with hard drive space 
- The most space you 'stake', the better your odds of being selected to mine the next block. 
- Consensus algorithm generates large data sets called 'plots' which consume storage 
- Major criticism - Method has no deterrent for bad actors/rogue nodes

### 3.9 Hashing (Demo) 

Hashing 
- One way cryptographic function 
- Make sure it can't be decrypted 

Goal is that every time you write to a blockchain, the block will change and the hash will be different. 
- Block, Nonce, Data. 

## L04: Blockchain Use Cases

### 4.1 Business Use Cases and Models

A business model describes the rationale of how an organisation creates, delivers, and captures value in economic, social, cultural, or other contexts. 

E.g.,
- Business-to-Business (B2B) 
- Business-to-Consumer (B2C) 

- Consumer-to-Consumer (C2C) 
- Consumer-to-Business (C2B) 
- Business-to-Government (B2G) 
- Government-to-Business (G2B) 
- Government-to-Citizen (G2C) 

Blockchain Technology is already disrupting 
- Financial Services, Government Services, Healthcare, Real Estate and other industries on smaller scale 

Blockchain Technology is already evolving to where an organisation has to consider its effects to the business model in three main ways: 
- Technical 
- Business 
- Legal 

Use of Blockchain technology in several industries is affecting how services are delivered and how many people are involved in the delivery of that service 
- E.g., if you are a large financial organisation, and you do a lot of international transfers, it helps to rule out accountants, attorneys and intermediaries that are involved in the transfer. 
- Essentially a "disruption" in the business model is occurring. 

### 4.2 Blockchain Use Cases - G2C

- Dubai is not the only government investing in blockchain. 
- However they clearly are one of the more visible and [heavily invested](https://www.the-blockchain.com/2017/02/16/smart-dubai-office-sdo-1776-launch-blockchain-challenge/). 
- Dubai aims to be a pioneer in the adoption of emerging technologies such as Blockchain, which it recognizes has a major potential to transform city services 
- Dubai is investing in the Smart Dubai Office (SDO) and 1776 Launch Blockchain Challenge 

Dubai Blockchain strategy is based on three pillars 
- Government Efficiency 
  - Implementing Blockchain technology in government services 
- Industry Creation 
  - Supporting the creation of a Blockchain industry through empowering startups and businesses 
- Thought Leadership 
  - Leading the global thinking on Blockchain technology 

Dubai Blockchain strategy benefits 
- Dubai's adoption of blockchain technology at a city-wide scale is a testament to its commitment to positively transform government from service provider to service enabler 
- "We believe blockchain technology. With its built-in efficiency, accountability and security, blockchain holds a key to achieving our vision." 

### 4.3 Blockchain Use Cases - B2C

B2C Use Case 
- A Business-to-Consumer (B2C) is business or transactions conducted directly between a company and consumers who are the end-users of its products or services. 
- Services being provided to the consumer is an area of interest to the company 
-Consumers increasingly want more transparency in the services and products they purchases 
- Some area of focus 
  - Food Supply Traceability 
  - Resource Procurement 
  - Labor 
  - Logistics 
  - Compliance
- Verticals that are heavily exploring blockchain for transparency are 
  - Financials 
  - Logistics 
  - Charity Funding 
  - Agriculture Tracking 
  - Precious Metals 
  - Numerous other Verticals 

The jewelry industry has been known for fraud, child labor issues, false metal mining and a clear lack of transparency. 
- Precious metals consortium with IBM has established a blockchain initiative around how transparency can be brought to the consumer 
- The "TrustChain Initiative" tracks and authenticates diamonds and precious metals through every stage of the supply chain as it becomes a piece of finished jewelry. 
- The collaboration's goal is to instill trust in the origin and ethical sourcing of jewelry by bringing together a community of responsible and ethical organisations across the complex and multi-tiered jewelry supply chain. 
- Consumers will see that "TrustChain" establishes a trusted product with documented provenance and brings together quality assurance, social and environmental responsibility and authenticity spanning the entire jewelry ecosystem - From miners, manufacturers, wholesale suppliers and retailers - on a single digital platform. 

Benefits to the consumers from a blockchain solution is clear and established 
- Transparency to the consumers 
- Responsibility from the suppliers 
- Ethical Sourcing validation 
- Labor Verification 
- Immutable shared view

### 4.4 Common Use Cases for Cryptocurrency

- It is important to note whether to use permissioned or permissionless blockchains due to different use cases 
- Part of the use case may require a cryptocurrency or use of a token 
- Blockchain serve as the basis technology in which cryptocurrencies are a part of the ecosystem 
- They go hand-in-hand, and cryptocurrency is often necessary to transact on a permissionless blockchain 
  - Blockchains that are cryptocurrencies are the tokens used within these networks to send value and pay for these transactions 
  - They can be used to digitize value of an asset as well 
  - E.g., Bitcoin, Litecoin and Monero 

- Blockchains that are private for an enterprise don't generally need a cryptocurrency 
  - Private or Private Chain (Permissioned) 
  - E.g., Hyperledger, R3 Corda 

- A blockchain does not require cryptocurrency, but a cryptocurrency requires blockchain 
- The use case for cryptocurrency is more for permissionless blockchain instead of private/permissioned blockchain 

### 4.5 Database vs Blockchain Architecture

Legacy Architectures in Database 
- SQL or NoSQL 
- Whether centralised or distributed 
- Traditional databases use client-server network architectures 
- Database processing is quicker 
- Traditional databases use client-server network architecture 
- Control of the database remains with a designated authority (Require database administrator) 
- If security of the authority is compromised, then the data can be modified or even deleted 
- CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete). More flexible than blockchain. 

Database maintain 
- Disintermediation 
- Centralisation 
- Performance 
- Agility 
- Privacy 

Blockchain allows for two specific function: 
- Validation of a transaction 
- Writing of a new transaction 

Blockchain Properties: 
- Trustlessness 
  - Network participants help secure the network so there is no need for a centralised third party to be employed 
- Replication 
  - Blockchain stores a copy on every computer in the network 
- Immutable 
  - Once a piece of information is appended to the blockchain, it can never be edited 
- Timestamp 
  - A timestamp is a sequence of characters or encoded information identifying when a certain event occurs 
- Atomicity 
  - Either all of the operations in a transaction execute successfully and take the system to a different consistent state or nothing happens at all 
- Consistency
  - Integrity constraints must be maintained so that the database is consistent before and after the transaction 
- Isolation 
  - Multiple transactions can occur concurrently without leading to inconsistency of database state 
- Durability 
  - Once the transaction has completed execution, the updates and modifications to the database are written to disk 

### 4.6 Blockchain as a Service

Blockchain as a Service (BaaS) 
- Generally deployed on a Cloud Computing solution 
- Develop, test and deploy secure blockchain apps 
- Nodes are setup by provider 
- Proof-of-Concepts (POC) 
  - Use BaaS to enable a POC. For E.g, to deploy our own Ethereum and create custom deployment of it, we are able to test BaaS on Amazon or Azure to test if it fits requirements 
- No need for CAPEX or OPEX for management of infrastructure 

BaaS Providers 
- MS Azure 
- AWS 
- IBM 
- Stratis 
- HPE 
- Oracle 

- IBM supports Hyperledger very well. 
- Azure and AWS supports Ethereum differently. 

### 4.7 Cost Modelling 

One of the challenges when defining a blockchain, is the cost that is involved. 
Organisation uses two ways to fund projects. 

CAPEX
- Large expenditures that require signatures from executives, Board of Directors. 
- Goes through procurement in a lot of places 
- Takes longer time to process 

OPEX 
- Operational funds that are distributed to the organisation 
- Usually small amount of money to pay for subscriptions or training or day-to-day expenses 
- Does not need to go through CAPEX expenditures (getting approval from executives or BoD or procurement in lot of places) 

CAPEX is larger amount of money while OPEX is smaller amount of money. 

Areas of Cost Modelling 
- Procurement Process 
  - How are we going to go to provide a solution to the customer (CAPEX or OPEX?) 
    - Talk to point-of-contact, customer, client to better understand 
- Procurement Effectiveness 
  - How long will it take to occur 
  - OPEX can process procurements quickly 
  - CAPEX will process procurement much longer 
- Benchmarking 
  - How long is it going to take the solution from its infancy to deployment 
- Cost/Timelines 
- Pricing Strategy 
  - For blockchain
