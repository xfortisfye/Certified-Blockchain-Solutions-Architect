#### L11: Hyperledger Blockchain Platform and Project 

# 11.1 Hyperledger Basics Overview

Hyperledger is an open-source project that came out of the Linux Foundation and was created in to advance cross-industry blockchain technologies 
- Hyperledger is a popular blockchain solution among enterprises 
- A global open-source collaboration (e.g., IBM) involving leaders from numerous industries 
- Ethereum is set up by Ethereum foundation, but not as formal as how Hyperledger is set up. 
- Hosted by Linux Foundation which provides a governance structure and oversight to the Hyperledger community 
  - Uses a modular umbrella approach to enterprise blockchains 
    - Hyperledger is not one solution, it is a portfolio of different blockchain solutions that are integrated or more complementary to each other. 
 
Hyperledger Project consist of the following: 
- Infrastructure 
  - Ecosystems that accelerate open development and commercial adoption 
    - Linux Foundation has a marketing team and leadership team to promote Hyperledger as a whole 
- Framework 
  - A portfolio of differentiated approaches to business blockchain frameworks developed by a growing community of communities 
    - The consortium recognised that one blockchain solution does not make sense. 
    - Thus need a portfolio of different solutions to enable the right solution for the right business challenge 
- Tools 
  - Typically built for one framework, and through common license and community of communities approach, ported to other frameworks. 
    - Variety of tools has been built into the framework, in which these tools can be use through a common license and able to get support from the community 

# 11.2 Hyperledger Portfolio Overview 

Hyperledger Project has a modular schema to enable different facets of the Hyperledger Project and provide specific solutions for businesses 
- Infrastructure 
- Frameworks 
- Tools 
 
Infrastructure Module 
- Leadership 
- Governing Board 
- Marketing 
- Technical Steering Committee 
 
Framework Module 
- Hyperledger Indy 
  - Tools, library, and reusable components for providing digital identities rooted on blockchains or other distributed ledgers so that they are interoperable across administrative domains, applications, and any other silo 
    - Provides the capability to integrate with other solutions 
- Hyperledger Fabric 
  - Act as the foundation area for developing applications or blockchain solutions with a modular architecture 
  - Allows components such as consensus and membership services to be plug-and-play 
    - Able to add cryptocurrency capabilities as well with little bit of backend work 
- Hyperledger Iroha 
  - A business blockchain framework that is designed to be simple and easy to incorporate into infrastructural projects requiring distributed ledger technology 
    - A different approach but less complex than Fabric 
- Hyperledger Sawtooth 
  - A modular platform for building, deploying, and running distributed ledgers 
  - Includes a novel consensus algorithm, Proof of Elapsed Time (PoET), which targets large distributed validator populations with minimal resource consumption 
- Hyperledger Burrow (like a blockchain client) 
  - Permissionable smart contract machine 
    - First of its kind when released in 2014 
  - Provides a modular blockchain client with a permissioned smart contract interpreter built in part to the specification of EVM 
 
Tools Module 
- Hyperledger Quilt 
  - A development from NTT data, is a Java implementation of the inter-ledger protocol by Ripple, which is designed to transfer values across distributed and non-distributed ledgers 
    - Able to tie in other cryptocurrencies if needed or integrate Ripple with your blockchain 
- Hyperledger Cello 
  - Contributed by IBM 
  - Seeks to bring the on demand as-a-service deployment model into the blockchain ecosystem in order to reduce the effort required to create, manage, and terminate blockchains 
- Hyperledger Composer 
  - Contributed by IBM and Oxchains 
  - Set of collaboration tools for building blockchain business networks that accelerate the development of smart contracts and blockchain applications, as well as their deployment across a distributed ledger 
  - Go-to tool for Hyperledger when it comes to developing and deploying the blockchain solution 
- Hyperledger Explorer 
  - Originally contributed by IBM, Intel and DTCC (Depository Trust Corporation) 
  - It can view, invoke, deploy or query blocks, transactions and associated data, network information (name, status, list of nodes), chain codes and transaction families and other relevant information stored in the ledger 
    - Similar to Ethereum blockchain Explorer 
  - Goal is to see what is going on in the ledger 
- Hyperledger Caliper 
  - Blockchain benchmark tool that allows users to measure performance of a specific implementation with predefined use cases 
  - It's in Alpha mode at time of writing (2017) 
  - Contributed by developers of numerous organisation 

# 11.3 Hyperledger Fabric Reference Architecture

![img](img/11.3_01.png)

Hyperledger is an enterprise blockchain that contains services such as APIs, SDKs, CLIs. 
- Membership Service 
  - Permission to access as we do not want to let any node into our network 
- Blockchain Service 
- Transaction Service 
- Chain Code / Smart Contract Code 

Under services, you have security, general services and chain code. 
- Security 
  - Registration, Identity and Access Management, High Availability 
- General Service 
  - Consensus Algorithm, Ledger, P2P Communication Protocol, Storage (for ledger) 
- Chaincode 
  - Deployed in container, has container service, and container registry 
 
Lastly, it has event management and messaging services. 
 
At high level, this is the Hyperledger Fabric Architecture.
