# M.1 Miscellaneous

CBSA Exam 
- Read situation and decide need permissioned or permissionless blockchain 
- Currently this bounty is 25 bitcoins, but this value will halve every 210,000 blocks (might need to know what is the current status) 
 
Proof of Work 
- First blockchain consensus algorithm 
- Saotshi Nakamoto created for the BC blockchain 
- PoW miners solve hard problems to create blocks 
- It is a race 

A blockchain does not require cryptocurrency, but a cryptocurrency requires blockchain 
The use case for cryptocurrency is more for permissionless blockchain instead of private/permissioned blockchain 

Important to know the definition of CAPEX and OPEX 

6.2 Important to understand the structure of how the nodes and the virtual machine and then how smart contracts and the Dapps are structured (in both Top-Down / Bottom-Up Approach) 

7.2 Make sure you are able to identify what the benefits of a smart contract are 

7.3 Important to understand the smart contract workflow. Understand how a Smart Contract works, understand that it's a contract, from a non-legal perspective, but just think of a contract as a way to meet terms, to trigger events, and then to settle. And remember that there's on-chain and off-chain ways to settle a Smart Contract. 

8.3 Understand the different networks in Ethereum 

8.8 Gas is what keeps EVM running, and the structure of the EVM itself 

9.1 Know all the difference on what is a language, IDE, client and the different DApps browser and testnets 

9.3 Mist is a full node and it's used to browse dApps 

9.4 Parity is an option for developing and building and viewing dApps. It is a browser with built-in Ethereum Wallet. Each tool set has its pros and cons. 

9.5 Now on the CBSA exam, the main thing I want you to know about Geth is that this is an implementation of the Ethereum network. The two most common ones is Geth and the other would be Parity. So as long as you know that for the CBSA, you will be in good shape. 

9.7 Metamask is a bridge to the Ethereum network. A web 3.0 browser. It is a zero client. 

9.8 So for the CBSA exam, what I want to make sure you understand is that the functional requirements drive the technical requirements and the technical requirements are actually what's going to define the tasks and the tasks then, once you define the tasks, you can get together your estimates of what you need, how much time it'll take to complete, any skill sets you may need, as well.  

Your job as a Certified Blockchain Solutions Architect is to actually be able to define these requirements and then come up with the requirements and estimates, skill sets to successfully define a blockchain architecture. And for the exam, just remember the difference between functional and technical requirements. And that these are driven generally by the personas. 

10.1 Testing 
- When testing Ethereum apps, always follow the proper testing flow 
  - Local testing (e.g., laptop) > Test Network (e.g., Ropsten) > To Production (i.e., MainNet) 
- Agile approach works well for pre-release but not for post-release / releasing to production 

10.2 Truffle is development environment or development framework, that is used to create a pipeline to deploy Smart Contracts and test. This is commonly used with Ganache. 

10.3 It is a personal Ethereum blockchain that you would deploy to test an execute commands typically with Truffle. 

10.4 Remix is an online integrated development environment and it is solidity based. 

11.3 It is important to have a general idea of what Hyperledger can do and the architecture for the Hyperledger fabric blockchain service. 

12.2 There is deploy and invoke functions in Hyperledger Fabric 

13.2 So for the CBSA exam, just realize that Composer is used to deploy applications to hyperledger fabric. 

14.1 What hyperledger Fabric is, the basics of design, and understand that you could use hyperledger explorer to monitor hyperledger fabric 

# M.2 Dates

- Solidity was proposed in August 2014 by Dr Gavin Wood for Ethereum 

# M.3 Improvement Protocols

- BIP 66: Soft Fork on Bitcoin's signature validation 
- P2SH: Soft Fork that enabled multi-signature addresses in Bitcoin's network 
- Improves scalability issue for Segwits (UTX0) 
- Enables off-chain protocols for Segwits (P2SH256) 
- Requires community consensus (E.g., BIP 91) 
- E.g., BIP 32 
- E.g., BIP 2 

ERC20 defines a common list of protocols that an Ethereum token has to implement. 
- Allows developers to program behaviour of new tokens within the Ethereum ecosystem 
  - Common with crowdfunding companies via Initial Coin Offerings
