# 3.1  What is a Consensus Algo

Consensus is a dynamic way of reaching agreement in a group 
- In contrast, voting just settles for a majority rule without any thought for the feelings and well-being of the minority 
- Hence, consensus makes sure that an agreement is reached which could benefit the entire group as a whole. 
 
Example of BC Algos: 
- Proof of Work 
- Proof of Stake 
- Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) 
- Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) 
- Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) 

# 3.2  What Is Mining

Bitcoin Mining 
- In Bitcoin, mining is the process of adding transaction records to Bitcoin's public ledger 
- This ledger of past transactions is called the blockchain as it is a chain of blocks 
- The blockchain serves to confirm transactions to the rest of the network as completed 
- Bitcoin nodes use the blockchain to distinguish legitimate Bitcoin transactions from attempts to re-spend coins that have already been spent. 

Bitcoin mining is called so because it resembles the mining of other commodities. 
- Requires exertion and it slowly makes new currency available at a rate that resembles the rate at which commodities like gold are mined from the ground 
- Bitcoin uses the Hashcash proof of work algorithm 
- A reward is given when a block is discovered, the discoverer may award themselves a certain number of bitcoins, which is agreed-upon by everyone in the network 
- Currently this bounty is 25 bitcoins, but this value will halve every 210,000 blocks 
- The miner is awarded the fees paid by users sending transactions (Miners could receive the transaction fee which could be significant) 

- The fee is an incentive for the miner to include the transaction in their block 
 
Example of BC Algos: 
- Proof of Work 
- Proof of Stake 
- Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) 
- Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) 
- Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) 
 
Proof of Work 
- First blockchain consensus algorithm 
- Saotshi Nakamoto created for the BC blockchain 
- PoW miners solve hard problems to create blocks 
- PoW runs on a system of "the longest chain wins" 
- Expensive, both in terms of cost and environments 
- E.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin 
 
Proof of Stake 
- Blocks aren't created by miners doing work 
- Blocks are created by minters staking their tokens to "bet" on which blocks are valid  
- In the case of a fork, minters spend their tokens voting on which fork to support 
- Attacks costly but more environmental 
E.g., Peercoin, Dash, Ethereum (in the future) 
 
Delegated Proof-of-Stake 
- Miners can collaborate to make blocks instead of competing like in PoW and PoS 
- By partially centralizing the creation of blocks, DPoS can run orders much faster than most other algorithms 
- Cheaper transaction, faster and centralised 
- E.g., Steemit and EOS 
 
Byzantine Fault Tolerance 
- Classic problem is distributed computing and is explained with Byzantine generals 
- Pre-selected generals and meant for a private blockchain. 
- PBFT runs incredibly efficiently 
- High transaction throughput, but centralised/permission based 
- E.g., Hyperledger, Ripple and Stellar 
 
Directed Acyclic Graphs 
- DAGs are a form of consensus that doesn't use the blockchain data strcture and handles transactions mostly asynchronously. 
- The plus is theoretically infinite transactions per second (Don't have the nodes or the blockchain that slows down the transaction per second) 
- E.g., IOTA, Hashgraph

# 3.3  Proof-Of-Work (PoW)

Proof of Work 
- First blockchain consensus algorithm 
- Saotshi Nakamoto created for the BC blockchain 
- PoW miners solve hard problems to create blocks 
- PoW runs on a system of "the longest chain wins" 
- Expensive, both in terms of cost and environments 
- E.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin 
 
- Goal of proof of work is to solve the problem; a race. Whoever solves the problem first, gets the reward. 
- Ethereum still uses proof-of-work.  
- Depending on release of Ethereum, homestead version of Ethereum uses Ethash which is another PoW consensus algo. 

# 3.4  Proof-of-Stake (PoS)

Proof of Stake 
- Blocks aren't created by miners doing work 
- Blocks are created by minters staking their tokens to "bet" on which blocks are valid  
- In the case of a fork, minters spend their tokens voting on which fork to support 
- Attacks costly but more environmental 
E.g., Peercoin, Dash, Ethereum (in the future) 

# 3.5 Compare PoW and PoS

| | PoW (Mines) | PoS (Stakes) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Blocks by mining | Yes | No |
| Speed | Slower TPS | Faster TPS |
| Rewards | Yes | Yes/No |
| Costing | Expensive | Cost Efficient |
| Example | BTC, Ether, LTC | Stratis, Pivix, Dash (Hybrid) |

- PoW is uses large amount of memory, TPUs, and Essex and specialised computer chips to process and mine cryptocurrencies. 
- PoS is not as intensive and generally have entities or organisations or even individuals putting up a monetary contribution in tokens to be able to participate in that blockchain as a minor. Proof of Stake is really a combination or could be hybrid or could be not really mining it all, it's more of a betting process. 
 
- Pivix is a hybrid of dash but dash uses the combination of PoW and PoS. 

# 3.6 Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) 

Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) 
- Miners can collaborate to make blocks instead of competing like in PoW and PoS 
- By partially centralizing the creation of blocks, DPoS can run orders much faster than most other algorithms 
- Cheaper transaction, faster and centralised 
- E.g., Steemit and EOS 
 
- Divides the consensus model in two fundamental parts 
  - Electing a group of block producers 
  - Scheduling production 
- Not everyone in a DPoS network can produce blocks to validate a transaction 
- Participants who hold token can cast votes to elect block producers 
- Voters are weighted by voter's stake. The block producer candidates that receive the most votes are those who produce blocks 
- In DPoS, you can think as stakeholders, notaries, block producers and witnesses 
 
Benefits 
- Separation of concerns where participants can be grouped appropriately, and mining and token control can be controlled better 
- Stakeholder (Token) control 
- Scalability to restrict the number of participants 
- On chain governance (Allow where to control where the network, nodes, participants are to comply to regulation) 
- Avoid "Nothing at stake" problem in which a small group of validators can take control of the network 
  - The fixed number of token validators in DPoS as well as the dynamic election model prevents this issues from happening 

# 3.7 Byzantine Fault Tolerance 

Byzantine Fault Tolerance 
- Classic problem is distributed computing and is explained with Byzantine generals 
- Pre-selected generals and meant for a private blockchain. 
- PBFT runs incredibly efficiently 
- High transaction throughput, but centralised/permission based 
- E.g., Hyperledger, Ripple and Stellar 
 
Byzantine General Problem state that no two node on a decentralised network can entirely and irrefutably guarantee that they are displaying the same data. 
- Satoshi Nakamoto solved the issue with BTC PoW Consensus Algo. 
- Essentially a "Byzantine" node is a node that can be rogue by not forwarding packets or perhaps mislead other nodes involved in the P2P Consensus network.  

# 3.8 Other Blockchain Consensus Algo

Proof of Elapsed Time (Proprietary Algorithm) 
- Created by Intel to run on their trusted execution environment  
- Similar to Proof-of-Work but more energy efficient 
- Major issue: Requires trust in Intel, places power back in the hands of a central authority 
- Good Solution in cases where we are able to trust an authority such as Intel. 
 
Proof of Authority 
- Uses a set of "authorities" - Nodes that are explicitly allowed to create new blocks and secure the blockchain 
- Replacement for PoW (Private blockchains only) 
- Earn the right to become a validator/authority 

Proof of Burn 
- Coins are "burned" by sending them to an address where they cannot be retrieved 
- The more coins you burn, the better your chances of being selected to mine the next block. 
- Eventually, you must stake more by burning more coins. 
 
Proof of Activity 
- Hybrid of PoW and PoS 
- Empty template blocks are mined (PoW), then filed with transactions which are validated via Proof-of-Stake 
- Similar to Dash. 
 
Proof of Capacity 
- Pay to play with hard drive space 
- The most space you 'stake', the better your odds of being selected to mine the next block. 
- Consensus algorithm generates large data sets called 'plots' which consume storage 
- Major criticism - Method has no deterrent for bad actors/rogue nodes

# 3.9 Hashing (Demo) 

Hashing 
- One way cryptographic function 
- Make sure it can't be decrypted 

Goal is that every time you write to a blockchain, the block will change and the hash will be different. 
- Block, Nonce, Data.
