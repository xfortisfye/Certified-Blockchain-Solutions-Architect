# 15.1 Let's Review Terminology

Blockchain 
- Type of distributed ledger, comprised of unchangeable, digitally recorded data in packages called blocks (rather like collating them on to a single sheet of paper) 
 
Block 
- A container data structure 
- In Bitcoin, a block contains more than 500 transactions on average 
- Contains digital signature, timestamp and relevant information 
- Block size is defined in megabits 
 
Cryptocurrency 
- Form of digital currency based on mathematics where encryption techniques are used to regulate the generation of units of currency and verify the transfer of funds 
 
dApp is a decentralised application that must be completely open-source, it must operate autonomously and with no entity controlling the majority of its tokens 
 
DAO (Decentralised Autonomous Organisation) 
- Think of it as a corporation run without any human involvement under the control of an incorruptible set of business rules 
 
Decryption 
- Process of turning cipher-text back into plaintext 
 
Encryption 
- Process of turning a clear-text message (plaintext) into a data stream (cipher-text) that looks like a meaningless and random sequence of bits 
 
Ether 
- Native token of Ethereum blockchain which is used to play for transaction fees, miner rewards, and other services on the network 
 
Ethereum 
- An open software platform based on blockchain technology that enables developers to write smart contracts, and build and deploy decentralised applications 
 
Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) 
- Built into the software running on the Ethereum protocol. It executes smart contracts. 
- Ethereum programs are written in the Solidity langauge 
 
EVM code 
- Programming language in which accounts on the Ethereum blockchain can contain code 
 
Gas 
- Measurement that is roughly equivalent to computational steps for Ethereum 
- Evert transaction is required to include a gas limit and a fee that it is willing to pay per gas 
- Miners have the choice of including the transaction and collecting the fee or not 
  - The higher your transaction fees, the quicker your transaction is going to happen 
- Every operation has a gas expenditure on an EVM 
 
Fork 
- Creation of an ongoing alternative version of the blockchain by simultaneously creating two blocks on different parts of the network 
- E.g., Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Litecoin Cash 
- Creates two parallel blockchains where one of the two is the winning blockchain 
 
Ledger 
- An append-only record store, where records are immutable and may hold more general information than financial records 
 
Token 
- Digital identity for something that can be owned 
 
Tokenless Ledger 
- A distributed ledger that doesn't require a native cryptocurrency to operate 
 
Wallet 
- File that contains a collection of private keys 
 
Satoshi Nakamato 
- Name used by the unknown person or persons who designed bitcoin and created its original reference implementation 
 
satoshi 
- Smallest unit of the bitcoin currency recorded on the blockchain. 
  - One hundred millionth of a single bitcoin (0.00000001 BTC) 
 
Merkle Tree 
- A common Blockchain design, Merkle trees are used to create a lightweight digital fingerprint of all the transactions within a block 
- Provide an index of all the transactions on the blockchain 
 
Cryptography 
- Study of how to send information back and forth securely in the presence of adversaries 
  - The Secret 
    - The data which we are trying to protect 
  - The Key 
    - A piece of data used for encrypting and decrypting the secret 
  - The Function 
    - The process or function used to encrypt the secret 
  - The Cipher 
    - The encrypted secret data, output of the function 
 
Public Key Cryptography 
- Public Key 
  - Verify the digital signature of a given key pair 
- Private Key 
  - Sign/approve any transaction/action that might be made by the holder of the key pair
