# 10.1  Blockchain Testing 

Testing Ethereum Blockchain 
 
Ganache (formerly known as TestRPC) 
- Allows for testing and development with a local Blockchain simulation 
 
Truffle 
- A tool with a framework to release Blockchain application management system that allows for deployment and testing on Ethereum test and production Blockchains 
- Allow you to run multiple instances and see how it's going to run in your test environment and when you want to deploy it to MainNet 
 
Testing 
- When testing Ethereum apps, always follow the proper testing flow 
  - Local testing (e.g., laptop) > Test Network (e.g., Ropsten) > To Production (i.e., MainNet) 
- On Ethereum public Blockchain, make sure to use a tool such as Ganache (TestRPC) to test Smart Contracts locally before pushing to a test or production Blockchain 
- Agile Development 
  - Agile approach works well for pre-release but not for post-release / releasing to production 
    - Smart Contract is a permanent record on the Blockchain and cannot be removed once deployed 
    - Killing or calling a contract's self-destruct function (if implemented), will come with serious considerations. Hence, it is not recommended to continue an Agile cycle of continuous release and development once a contract is pushed to production 
      - We could kill the smart contract, but it is does not follow Agile best practices 

# 10.2  Truffle (Demo)

[Truffle](https://truffleframework.com)
- Package Management Framework that use Ethereum with 
- Developers often use it to integrates with Ganache 
- Goal of using a popular framework such as Truffle will help to create a pipeline and deploy software and test Smart Contracts in a fully integrated solution. 
- Install with NPM (Package Manager) 
- Truffle is development environment or development framework, that is used to create a pipeline to deploy Smart Contracts and test. This is commonly used with Ganache.

# 10.3  Ganache (Demo)

Ganache 
- When we use Truffle, we tend to prefer to use it with Ganache 
- Able to deploy a local personal Ethereum blockchain that can run commands and test out the environment that we're deploying, testing and running. 
  - Quickly fire up a personal Ethereum blockchain which you can use to run tests, execute commands, inspect state while controlling how the chain operates - from Ganache website 
- It is a personal Ethereum blockchain that you would deploy to test an execute commands typically with Truffle. 

# 10.4 Remix

[Remix](http://remix.ethereum.org)
- Online Integrated Development Environment that focuses on the development and deployment of Solidity Smart Contracts 
- Able to develop and test smart contracts without downloading any software or invest in any development environments 
- Good Solution if you intent to 
  - Develop Smart Contracts 
    - As it has a fully integrated solidity editor 
  - Debug a Smart Contract's execution 
  - Access the state and properties of an already deployed Smart Contract 
  - Debug already committed transaction 
  - Analyse solidity code to reduce coding mistakes and to enforce best practices 

# 10.5 Remix (Demo) 

[Remix](http://remix.ethereum.org) is an online integrated development environment to play around with Solidity code 
- Points out any issue in execution 
- Able to select compiler version 
- Able to run analysis 
- Help to deploy, debug and develop Solidity-based contracts
